Every Actor/Actress have their own motivation to work hard and be part of movies that have large veiwership and recognition. The motivation could be either financial success or great praise for their work by critics and the auidence. There are so many 

# Correlation between actor features and success metrics (building credibility for our chosen features)

Linear relations between the actor features and also with ratings, revenue and budget

## Non-trivial difference between popularity and critical acclaim []
The quote 
> Whether the work that I do shall succeed or achieve critical acclaim is for the audience to decide.

by Amitabh Bhachan is proof that there is difference between the two still remains non-trivial

Many movies such as Tenet, Avatar and other huge budget movies backed by very well acclaimed directors have lead to success by both metrics.

# Conclusion

We attempt to provide a data science approach to movie casting based on correlations with success and trends over time, to identify patterns and features that may be important in deciding who is a better fit to play the leading role for your movie. In this attempt we also try to quantify differences if any between the recipe to get awards or make money, with exceptions both (masterpiece) or neither (flops)
